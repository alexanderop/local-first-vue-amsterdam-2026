  ## How to Build Local-First Apps with Vue 

  Local-First is a new community that was created based on the idea of building apps where users have more control over them. It is related to the offline-first concept, but takes it a step further. In this talk, I will explain what Local-First means and how we can build applications with Vue

BREATHE. Smile. Make eye contact.

"Hey everyone — thanks for being here. Today I want to take you on a journey: from the jQuery days of manual DOM manipulation, through the reactive revolution that Vue gave us, all the way to a fundamentally different way of thinking about data in web applications."

- By the end: what local-first means, why it matters, how to start with Vue TODAY
- Promise: you'll leave with code you can use on Monday

Kyle Mathews

<!--
SLOW DOWN — this is a key quote.

- Kyle Mathews = founder of Gatsby, now CEO of ElectricSQL
- Said this on localfirst.fm podcast
- "With jQuery, you'd grab a DOM element, tweak text, remove a child... you were fiddling with the DOM constantly. Vue freed us from that."
- "But we're STILL doing the same imperative dance with DATA — fetch this, cache that, retry this, invalidate that."
- "We're in the jQuery era of data. History is repeating."

PAUSE — let the analogy sink in.

TRANSITION: "Let me show you what that looks like in Vue code..."

# What Does This Look Like in Code?

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts
// Traditional Vue — Loading Todos
const todos = ref([])
const loading = ref(true)
const error = ref(null)

async function fetchTodos() {
  loading.value = true
  try {
    todos.value = await fetch('/api/todos').then(r => r.json())
  } catch (e) {
    error.value = e
  } finally {
    loading.value = false
  }
}
```
```ts
// Traditional Vue — Now let's add a todo...
const todos = ref([])
const loading = ref(true)
const error = ref(null)

async function fetchTodos() { /* ... */ }

async function addTodo(title) {
  const temp = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), title, done: false }
  todos.value.push(temp) // optimistic update
  try {
    const saved = await fetch('/api/todos', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ title }),
    }).then(r => r.json())
    todos.value = todos.value.map(t => t.id === temp.id ? saved : t)
  } catch (e) {
    todos.value = todos.value.filter(t => t.id !== temp.id) // rollback
    error.value = e

// Traditional Vue — And we still need...

const error = ref(null)

onMounted(fetchTodos)

// TODO: offline support?   → service worker? local cache?
// TODO: optimistic UI?     → rollback on failure?
// TODO: multiple tabs?     → BroadcastChannel? shared worker?
```
```ts
// With LiveStore + Vue
const { store } = useStore()
const todos = useQuery(queryDb(() => tables.todos))

function addTodo(title) {
  store.commit(events.todoCreated({ id: crypto.randomUUID(), title }))
}

// Optimistic updates    — built in
// Real-time sync        — built in
// Offline reads/writes  — built in
// Conflict resolution   — git-like rebasing
// Multi-tab sync        — built in
```
````

<!--
Step 1: "OK, let's load some todos. Already 3 refs and a try/catch/finally just to fetch data."

CLICK → Step 2: "Now we want to add a todo. Optimistic update so it feels instant... but we need rollback if the server fails. Look how much code that is."

CLICK → Step 3: "And we're still not done. Real-time? Offline? Conflicts? Multiple tabs? Each one is another weekend of work."

CLICK → Step 4: Magic move collapses everything. "With LiveStore — useQuery gives you a reactive computed, store.commit writes an event that's applied locally and synced. Offline, real-time, conflict resolution via git-like rebasing, multi-tab — all built in."

# Why Dexie for Vue Developers?

<v-clicks>

1. Wraps IndexedDB with a **clean API**
2. `liveQuery()` is reactive like `computed()`

5. Built-in **auth + conflict resolution**

</v-clicks>

<Callout v-click type="info">

**Progressive upgrade path:** Dexie (local only) → `npm install dexie-cloud-addon` → DexieCloud (sync + auth + collaboration). Same API. Same queries. Now it syncs.

# The Incredible Journey Test

Martin Kleppmann defines **truly local-first** as meeting three criteria:

1. **Multiplayer / multi-device sync** — works across devices and users
2. **Works offline** — full read + write without a network
3. **Survives the developer shutting down** — your data and workflow keep going

<div class="mt-4 text-sm">
<table class="w-full">
  <thead>
    <tr class="border-b border-white/20">
      <th class="text-left py-1.5 pr-4">Criterion</th>
      <th class="text-left py-1.5 px-2">Dexie Cloud</th>

      <td class="py-1.5 px-2">Tied to their servers</td>
    </tr>

      <td class="py-1.5 pr-4">Works offline</td>

**2 out of 3.** And #3 is the one that matters most — it's what separates offline-first from truly local-first. Some engines like Zero are open-source and self-hostable, but in practice most teams still rely on hosted infrastructure — and if that goes away, sync breaks.

# Pragmatism vs. Idealism

Movements succeed when **idealists define the vision** and **pragmatists build the infrastructure**.

Historical parallels:

<v-clicks>

- Cypherpunks → SSL → **Let's Encrypt**
- Free Software → Open Web → **GitHub + npm**
- Local-first ideals → Sync engines → **???**

</v-clicks>

We're in the <span v-mark="{ type: 'underline', color: '#ff6bed' }" class="font-bold">pragmatist phase</span> — the tools aren't perfect, but you can start today.

<Card v-click variant="muted" size="lg" class="mb-4">

### <span class="inline-flex items-center gap-2"><span class="i-ph-database-bold text-pink-400" /> Step 1: Use Dexie.</span>

Offline-first. 4/7 ideals. A **real improvement** for your users.

### <span class="inline-flex items-center gap-2"><span class="i-ph-download-simple-bold text-pink-400" /> Step 2: Let users export their data.</span>

JSON, CSV — whatever. Give them a **download button**. This is the simplest local-first gesture.

<Card v-click variant="muted" size="lg">

### <span class="inline-flex items-center gap-2"><span class="i-ph-binoculars-bold text-pink-400" /> Step 3: Watch this space.</span>

The generic sync engine is coming. When it arrives, upgrading from offline-first to local-first will be a **configuration change**, not a rewrite.

</Card>

<!--
"So what can you do on Monday?"

CLICK 1: "Step one: use Dexie. You get 4 out of 7 ideals. That's already a massive upgrade."

CLICK 2: "Step two: add a download button. Let users export their data. JSON, CSV — whatever. That's the SIMPLEST local-first gesture."

CLICK 3: "Step three: watch this space. When the generic sync protocol arrives, upgrading will be a config change, not a rewrite."
